Mark-recapture survival models with state uncertainty for radio-tagged animals.

This repository contains R and JAGS code used for generalized estimation of organismal survival when observations of mortality contain false-positive identification of fish (e.g., in closed systems or for animals with unreliable mortality-sensing radio tags).

The code makes extensive use of R code from [K\00E9ry and Schaub (2010) _Bayesian Population Analysis Using WinBUGS_](www.vogelwarte.ch/de/projekte/publikationen/bpa/)
